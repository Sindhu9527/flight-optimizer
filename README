Flight Optimizer is a program which calculates optimal routes between airports.

Main files:
RouteGenerator
- calculates routes given airport start and end weighted by distance and segment threshold.
FrequencyGenerator
- calculates frequency of individual routes
SkeletonGenerator
- generates a skeleton without cyclesâ€” that is, the minimum amount of routes weighted by frequency that will allow one to get from one airport to another.

To Run:
javac RouteGenerator.java
java RouteGenerator [.txt file] #
	-where [.txt file] is a .txt file containing flight info
	-where # is the threshold

The output will be a file called routes.txt with your shortest-flight output.

javac FrequencyGenerator.java
java FrequencyGenerator routes.txt 

The output will be a file called frequencies.txt.

javac SkeletonGenerator.java
java SkeletonGenerator frequencies.txt

The output will be two files called skeleton.txt and airportFrequencies.txt
